1. s = "23" + "!@" + "alm". What is the value of s?
2. s = s + "3". Is this a proper one line program?
3.
```
def add_two(x):
    print(x+2)

add_two(1)
add_two(2)
add_two(3)
add_two(4)
add_two(5)
add_two(6)
```
    a. What is the output of this program?
    b. Rewrite the program removing the 6 add_two calls and replacing it with a single for loop.

4. What is the output of the following program?
```
def local_vs_global():
    global x
    x = 3
    y = 4
    print(x, y) 
    
x = 1
y = 2
print(x, y)
local_vs_global()
print(x, y)
```
